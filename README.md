# just-mobile-security-mobile-docker
This Docker aims to help to the Mobile Cybersecurity Community to have several Android and iOS Tools pre-configured.

This docker was tested for Ubuntu 22.04 and using the [MASTG TOOLS](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tools) as reference. Covering the Generic, Android, iOS and Network tools in case it applies.

The full list implemented is covered in the following documment [Docker MASWE List Android & iOS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10kHjVb7YZzyA_nzCAFTjtfaSZa9TnsAgILbttIPcYTE/edit?gid=1839499844#gid=1839499844)

## Prerequisites

Docker Desktop is required to run this project locally. Please install Docker Desktop for your operating system before continuing.

macOS — [Install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/). 

Ubuntu — [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/ubuntu/)

Linux (All distros) — [Install Docker Desktop for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/) 

Windows — [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
><sub>In Windows Docker Desktop uses the WSL 2 backend on modern Windows; please make sure WSL 2 is enabled and configured before installing. </sub>



### How to run it?

1. Download the git project.
2. Build the docker container.
> sudo docker build -t just-mobile-security-mobile-docker .
3. Run the container
> docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace just-mobile-security-mobile-docker	

After that you only need to use the docker image as the following example.

> $ jadx


## Mobile Device Wi‑Fi Connectivity Guide

Due to various OS‑ and architecture‑specific limitations around exposing USB ports inside Docker containers, we’re sharing this **workaround** to use ADB, SSH, and Frida **over Wi‑Fi** from within the container.

---

Below are the steps to connect your Android and iOS devices over Wi‑Fi **from inside** the Docker container using ADB, SSH, and Frida.

---

### Android: ADB over Wi‑Fi

> **Prerequisite**: On your **host** machine (outside the container), enable wireless debugging on the device:
> ```
> adb tcpip 5555
> adb connect <DEVICE_IP>:5555
> ```
> This puts the device into TCP mode on port 5555.

Then, **inside** the container:

#### Re-connect via TCP (device is already listening)
```
adb connect <DEVICE_IP>:5555
```
#### Verify connection
```
adb devices
```
### Android: Frida over Wi‑Fi

Push and start the Frida server on the device:
```
adb shell "su -c 'nohup /data/local/tmp/frida-server 0.0.0.0:27042 >/dev/null 2>&1 &'"
```
From inside the container, list processes via Frida:
```
frida-ps -H <DEVICE_IP>:27042
```

### iOS: Frida via SSH + Wi‑Fi

> **Prerequisite**: Frida installed on your iPhone (e.g. via Sileo) so that frida-server auto-starts.

From inside the container, establish an SSH tunnel:
```
ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -fNT -L 27042:127.0.0.1:27042 root@<IPHONE_IP>
```
Verify the tunnel and list processes remotely:
```
frida-ps -H 127.0.0.1:27042
```
To close the tunnel when you’re done:
```
pkill -9 -f 'ssh.*27042'
```

## Additional tool implementations

Some additional tools were added to this docker image as Nuclei, disarm and more! These aren't within the OWASP Project (https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tools) if you want to add any additional tool, please create a PR for this repo with the tool and the instructions.
